# Product discovery

## Frameworks

**Double diamond**
> The double diamond framework encourages product teams to approach problems and solutions by diverging (starting broad to enable creative collaboration) and then converging (narrowing down to one or two key areas of focus).  It also provides a structure for understanding and defining user problems before jumping straight into a solution.

**F.O.C.U.S.E.D**
> FOCUSED is a user-oriented scoping methodology. It is a pragmatic approach. Over a short period of time, the team investigates a feature and tests its interest for the user. This reduces the development costs of a little-used feature. Product discovery is therefore complementary to product delivery.
