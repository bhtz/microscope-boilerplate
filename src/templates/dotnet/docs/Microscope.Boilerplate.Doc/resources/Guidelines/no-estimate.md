# No estimate delivery process

## Introduction
The "No Estimate" delivery process is an alternative approach to traditional project management, where the focus shifts from estimating task durations to delivering value incrementally and iteratively. In this approach, the emphasis is on continuous improvement, adaptability, and maximizing productivity. Here are some guidelines to implement the "No Estimate" approach in a product engineering organization, along with associated practices and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure success:

## Embrace Agile Methodologies
Adopt Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, to facilitate iterative development and quick feedback loops. Embrace the Agile principles of collaboration, responding to change, and delivering working software regularly.

## Prioritize User Value
Focus on delivering features and improvements that provide tangible value to end-users. Collaborate closely with product managers and stakeholders to understand customer needs and align development efforts accordingly.

## Predictability
"NoEstimates" bases its approach on the notion of forecasting and suggests that a team will be able to predict its speed of progress, in terms of US produced per capacity planning, thanks to data from 3 to 5 two-week iterations, including when it these are early project iterations, not very representative of the team's future cruising speed.

## Continuous Delivery and Integration
Invest in robust continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to ensure a smooth and automated release process. Frequent integration and delivery of smaller changes promote faster feedback and reduced risk.

## Short Iterations and Incremental Releases
Adopt short development iterations, such as two weeks or less, to deliver incremental improvements regularly. These iterations allow for quick course correction and adaptability to changing requirements.

## Focus on Cycle Time
Monitor cycle time, which is the time taken from idea to production deployment. Shortening cycle time is a key goal in the "No Estimate" approach as it emphasizes rapid delivery and faster feedback.

## Measure Customer Satisfaction
Use customer satisfaction surveys, Net Promoter Score (NPS), or other customer feedback mechanisms to measure the impact of delivered features on user satisfaction and loyalty.

## Monitor Lead Time
Lead time measures the time taken from the inception of a task or feature request to its completion. Keep track of lead time metrics to identify bottlenecks and optimize development processes.

## Team Velocity
While avoiding time-based estimates, measure team velocity in terms of completed work items per iteration. This can help teams in planning future iterations and managing workloads.

## Continuous Improvement
Encourage a culture of continuous improvement within the organization. Conduct regular retrospectives to identify areas of improvement, implement changes, and adapt to evolving needs.

## Celebrate Small Wins
Recognize and celebrate the achievements of the team, even for small incremental improvements. Positive reinforcement fosters a motivated and engaged team environment.

## Conclusion
The "No Estimate" delivery process is a value-driven and adaptive approach to software development that empowers product engineering organizations to focus on delivering customer value rather than meeting time-based estimates. By embracing Agile methodologies, using relative sizing, prioritizing user value, and employing continuous delivery practices, teams can achieve greater productivity and responsiveness. Monitoring KPIs such as cycle time, customer satisfaction, lead time, and team velocity will provide valuable insights to further enhance the organization's performance and deliver successful outcomes.
