## Observe

#### 🥸 First use case

**As a** {DOMAIN_USER},
**when** organizing my workdays,
**what matters most is** being efficient and thorough.
**However, it turns out that** the local tools on my computer are not user-friendly and accessible from any device, 
**so I have** to rely on my computer to access my schedule.
