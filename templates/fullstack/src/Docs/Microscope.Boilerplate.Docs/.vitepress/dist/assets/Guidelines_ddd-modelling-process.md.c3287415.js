Then you will be able to adapt and improve the process to suit your needs in any context. On a real project you&#39;ll often be jumping back and forth between these steps.</p><blockquote><p>This process is for beginners. It is not a linear sequence of steps that you should standardise as a best practice. Domain-Driven Design is an evolutionary design process which necessitates continuous iteration on all aspects of knowledge and design.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://github.com/ddd-crew/ddd-starter-modelling-process/raw/master/resources/ddd-starter-modelling-process-colored.png" alt="DDD Starter Modelling Process"></p><p><strong>Navigation:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#when-to-use-the-ddd-starter-modelling-process">When to use the DDD Starter Modelling Process?</a><ul><li><a href="#kicking-off-a-greenfield-project">Kicking Off a Greenfield Project</a></li><li><a href="#beginning-a-brownfield-migration">Beginning a Brownfield Migration</a></li><li><a href="#kicking-off-a-major-program-of-work">Kicking Off a Major Program of Work</a></li><li><a href="#explore-your-domain-for-new-learning-opportunities">Explore Your Domain for New Learning Opportunities</a></li><li><a href="#assess-current-state-of-your-project">Assess Current State of Your Project</a></li><li><a href="#re-organising-teams">Re-organising Teams</a></li><li><a href="#practicing-or-learning-ddd">Practicing or Learning DDD</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#how-to-adapt-the-process">How to Adapt the Process?</a><ul><li><a href="#start-with-collaborative-modelling">Start with Collaborative Modelling</a></li><li><a href="#start-by-assessing-it-landscape">Start by Assessing IT Landscape</a></li><li><a href="#code-before-confirming-architecture-and-team-boundaries">Code Before Confirming Architecture and Team Boundaries</a></li><li><a href="#repeat-steps-2-discover---6-organise-before-moving-to-7-define">Repeat Steps 2 (Discover) - 6 (Organise) Before Moving to 7 (Define)</a></li><li><a href="#organise-teams-before-designing-contexts">Organise Teams Before Designing Contexts</a></li><li><a href="#blending-definition-and-coding">Blending Definition and Coding</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#the-process">The Process</a><ul><li><a href="#understand">Understand</a></li><li><a href="#discover">Discover</a></li><li><a href="#decompose">Decompose</a></li><li><a href="#strategize">Strategize</a></li><li><a href="#connect">Connect</a></li><li><a href="#organise">Organise</a></li><li><a href="#define">Define</a></li><li><a href="#code">Code</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#how-the-ddd-starter-modelling-process-relates-to-the-whirlpool-process">How the DDD Starter Modelling Process relates to the Whirlpool Process</a></li><li><a href="#contributors">Contributors</a></li><li><a href="#contributions-and-feedback">Contributions and Feedback</a></li></ul><h2 id="when-to-use-the-ddd-starter-modelling-process" tabindex="-1">When to use the DDD Starter Modelling Process? <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-to-use-the-ddd-starter-modelling-process" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;When to use the DDD Starter Modelling Process?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If you&#39;re new to DDD or just not sure where to start, this process can reduce your cognitive load. It will guide you through following scenarios, and possibly others:</p><h3 id="kicking-off-a-greenfield-project" tabindex="-1">Kicking Off a Greenfield Project <a class="header-anchor" href="#kicking-off-a-greenfield-project" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Kicking Off a Greenfield Project&quot;">​</a></h3><p>At the start of a new project the number of things you need to think about can be overwhelming. One or two iterations of this process can help you put the foundations in place.</p><h3 id="beginning-a-brownfield-migration" tabindex="-1">Beginning a Brownfield Migration <a class="header-anchor" href="#beginning-a-brownfield-migration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Beginning a Brownfield Migration&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Before getting to work on modernising your legacy system, a few iterations of this process can help you to uncover essential information needed to create a vision for your target architecture.</p><h3 id="kicking-off-a-major-program-of-work" tabindex="-1">Kicking Off a Major Program of Work <a class="header-anchor" href="#kicking-off-a-major-program-of-work" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Kicking Off a Major Program of Work&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When starting a new initiative involves a significant investment across many teams, it is essential to cover the 8 steps in the process. This process can guide you through the first few iterations.</p><h3 id="explore-your-domain-for-new-learning-opportunities" tabindex="-1">Explore Your Domain for New Learning Opportunities <a class="header-anchor" href="#explore-your-domain-for-new-learning-opportunities" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Explore Your Domain for New Learning Opportunities&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Software development is a learning process.

In order to design, build, and evolve software systems most effectively, our decisions need to create the optimal business impact, which can only be achieved if we are aligned to the business goals, as well as supporting the users current and potential future needs.</p><p>Badly designed architecture and/or boundaries can have a negative impact or even make it impossible to achieve these goals.</p><p>As a starting point, we recommend <a href="https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Business Model Canvas</a> for the business perspective, <a href="https://www.jpattonassociates.com/user-story-mapping/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">User Story Mapping</a> for understanding the user vantage point.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/ddd-crew/ddd-starter-modelling-process/raw/master/resources/business-model-canvas.png" alt="The Business Model Canvas"></p><h4 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tools&quot;">​</a></h4><ul><li><a href="https://www.impactmapping.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Impact Mapping</a></li><li><a href="https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Business Model Canvas</a></li><li><a href="https://melissaperri.com/blog/2016/07/14/what-is-good-product-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Product Strategy Canvas</a></li><li><a href="https://learnwardleymapping.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Wardley Mapping</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jpattonassociates.com/user-story-mapping/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">User Story Mapping</a></li></ul><h4 id="who-to-involve" tabindex="-1">Who to Involve <a class="header-anchor" href="#who-to-involve" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Who to Involve&quot;">​</a></h4><ul><li>People who design, build, test software</li><li>People who have domain knowledge</li><li>People who understand the product and business strategy</li><li>Real end users, not only their representatives in your organisation</li></ul><h3 id="discover" tabindex="-1">Discover <a class="header-anchor" href="#discover" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Discover&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Discover the domain visually and collaboratively.</p><p>This is the most crucial aspect of DDD. You cannot skip discovery.

They&#39;re also both continuous and iterative.<br> But the DDD Starter Modelling Process covers more than the Whirlpool process by aiming at building a socio-technical architecture.<br> The picture below shows a possible overlap between the two processes.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/ddd-crew/ddd-starter-modelling-process/raw/master/resources/ENWhirlpoolVSStarter.jpg" alt="WhirlpoolVSStarter"></p><p>Needless to say that Eric Evan&#39;s Whirlpool process remains totally relevant today and gives people highly valuable insights and guidance on how to explore models.</p><h2 id="contributors" tabindex="-1">Contributors <a class="header-anchor" href="#contributors" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Contributors&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Thanks to all <a href="https://github.com/ddd-crew/ddd-starter-modelling-process/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">existing and future contributors</a> and to the following individuals who have all contributed to the DDD Starter Modelling Process:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/ciaranmcnulty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ciaran McNulty</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/emgsilva" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Eduardo da Silva</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/selketjah" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gien Verschatse</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/morcs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">James Morcom</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/__MaxS__" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Maxime Sanglan-Charlier</a></li></ul><h2 id="contributions-and-feedback" tabindex="-1">Contributions and Feedback <a class="header-anchor" href="#contributions-and-feedback" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Contributions and Feedback&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Domain-Driven Design Starter Modelling Process is freely available for you to use.
