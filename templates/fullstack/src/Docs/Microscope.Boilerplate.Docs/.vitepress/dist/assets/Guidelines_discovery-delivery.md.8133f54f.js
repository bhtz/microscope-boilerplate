It also validates your ideas before you spend time building them. Implementing a discovery cycle removes the need for assumptions. It ensures that you work on the best possible features for your product. This means you don’t waste resources on features your users don’t need. It means you can put all your time and effort into the right features. Dual-track agile lets you balance both the discovery and delivery tracks. As the development team work on one set of improvements, your discovery team can start figuring out what the next set should be. It takes the guesswork out of product management. Marty Cagan is a major proponent of the dual-track agile framework. He says, “our higher order objective is to validate our ideas the fastest, cheapest way possible”. Dual-track agile is the solution to that objective.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://aktiasolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dual-Track-Agile-Discovery-Delivery-Cycles-Lean-Product-Development-AKTIA-Solutions.jpg" alt="Discovery &amp; Delivery dual track"></p><h2 id="prioritization" tabindex="-1">Prioritization <a class="header-anchor" href="#prioritization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Prioritization&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Prioritization in product management is the disciplined process of evaluating the relative importance of work, ideas, and requests to eliminate wasteful practices and deliver customer value in the quickest possible way, given a variety of constraints.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://www.productboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/screenshot-2019-10-28-at-09-52-51.png" alt=""></p><h2 id="additional-resources" tabindex="-1">Additional resources <a class="header-anchor" href="#additional-resources" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Additional resources&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/an-ultimate-product-design-delivery-method-dual-track-agile-5f05cddf35c3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Dual track concept</a></p>',9),s=[i];function d(c,n,l,u,p,h){return t(),a("div",null,s)}const m=e(r,[["render",d]]);export{v as __pageData,m as default};
