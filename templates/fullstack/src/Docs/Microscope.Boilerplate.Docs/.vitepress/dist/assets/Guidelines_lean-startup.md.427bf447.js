Lean startup emphasizes customer feedback over intuition and flexibility over planning. This methodology enables recovery from failures more often than traditional ways of product development. Central to the lean startup methodology is the assumption that when startup companies invest their time into iteratively building products or services to meet the needs of early customers, the company can reduce market risks and sidestep the need for large amounts of initial project funding and expensive product launches and financial failures. While the events leading up to the launch can make or break a new business, it is important to start with the end in mind. This means thinking about the direction in which you want your business to grow and how to put all the right pieces in place to make this possible</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQHicqnPfCCk6g/article-cover_image-shrink_423_752/0/1626323424669?e=1695859200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=KnGmd4cJRgH8BRh4-mIYyFF3RCKXOyFpD7yPUZyTpsY" alt="Lean startup"></p><h2 id="additional-resources" tabindex="-1">Additional resources <a class="header-anchor" href="#additional-resources" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Additional resources&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.leblogdudirigeant.com/quest-ce-que-le-lean-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Définition Lean startup</a></li></ul>',5),o=[s];function r(l,d,c,u,p,h){return t(),a("div",null,o)}const f=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{_ as __pageData,f as default};
